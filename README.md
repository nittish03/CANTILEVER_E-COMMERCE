To start the website.
First start the server in the node server folder using nodemon index.js or node index.js
when starting the node server the mongo server should be started and kept on in the system along side node server
to do that. go to command prompt and write     mongod --dbpath <path>
then start the react app by npm start
the user data can be easily seen in the console as well whenever a new user enters


instead of buttons for scrolling through products i could also add the infinite scroll feature like i did in the news app but due to lack of resources like a good ecommerce api... i didn't .
hope u would take everything into account
