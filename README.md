To start the website.
First start the server in the node server folder using nodemon index.js or node index.js

then start the react app by npm start
the user data can be easily seen in the console as well whenever a new user enters

instead of buttons for scrolling through products i could also add the infinite scroll feature like i did in the news app but due to lack of resources like a good ecommerce api... i didn't .
hope u would take everything into account
